## Introduction
Welcome to the VMan tool. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and protect user data when you access and interact with our platform.

The VMan tool integrates key features from VMan and VATool to enhance data management, visualization, and interoperability with external systems. Given its role in handling Verbal Autopsy (VA) and Cause of Death (COD) data, we prioritize data privacy, security, and compliance with international and national data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other applicable frameworks.

By using the VMan tool, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.

## Data Sharing and Third-Party Access
We do not sell or commercially share user data. However, we may share data under the following circumstances:

### Authorized Organizational Access
 - Your organization or institution may have access to certain data, subject to role-based permissions.
 - Shared data remains within controlled environments to prevent unauthorized distribution.

### Integration with Third-Party Systems
 - If you integrate VMan with external tools through APIs, data may be shared according to the integration terms.
 - We are not responsible for third-party privacy practices and advise reviewing their policies before integration.

### Legal and Compliance Requirements
We may disclose user data if required to:

 - Comply with legal obligations, court orders, or regulatory authorities.
 - Investigate violations of these Terms or prevent security breaches.
 - Respond to emergency situations where public interest is at stake.

In all cases, we ensure that shared data is minimized, anonymized, or encrypted whenever possible.

## Data Security Measures
We implement strict security measures to safeguard user data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. These include:

 - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensuring users access only permitted data.
 - **End-to-End Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
 - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Strengthening account security.
 - **Regular Security Audits:** Conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
 - **Automated Anonymization:** De-identifying personal information where applicable.

Despite these safeguards, no system is completely immune to security risks. Users are responsible for safeguarding their credentials and reporting any security concerns immediately.

## Data Retention Policy
We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Retention periods depend on:

 - Legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., national health data laws).
 - Operational needs for research, analytics, or system maintenance.
 - User or organizational agreements specifying data deletion timelines.

After retention periods expire, data is either securely deleted or anonymized for research purposes.

## User Rights and Control Over Data
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your data:

 - Right to Access: Request a copy of the data we store about you.
