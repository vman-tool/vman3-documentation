The VMan website was developed as a unified platform integrating key features from VMan and VATool to enhance data management and visualization across multiple countries. The development process involved selecting robust technologies to ensure scalability, efficiency, and seamless integration with other systems.

**Technology Stack**
### Database: ArangoDB
 - Chosen for its flexibility as a multi-model database, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of structured and semi-structured data.
 - Supports both graph-based and document-based storage, making it ideal for managing complex VA data relationships.

### Backend: FastAPI
 - A high-performance web framework designed for building APIs efficiently.
 - Ensures rapid development with automatic data validation and high-speed performance.
 - Supports seamless integration with external systems through APIs, improving data interoperability.

### Frontend: Angular
 - Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface with a structured framework for building web applications.
 - Ensures modular development, making it easy to scale and maintain the platform.
 - Offers a smooth user experience with real-time data updates and interactive dashboards.

### Programming Language: Python
 - The core language behind both the backend and data management processes.
 - Used for handling data processing, automation, and API development.
 - Ensures strong community support, security, and reliability for managing VA data.

**Development Approach**

The system was designed to be flexible and configurable to accommodate different country-specific needs.
The backend APIs allow seamless system-to-system integration while maintaining role-based and level-based access control.
The frontend was built to provide standardized dashboards that align with global standards, making data visualization intuitive and accessible.
By leveraging these technologies, the VMan tool delivers an efficient, automated, and scalable solution for managing VA data while ensuring compliance with WHO-VA recommendations and Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) standards.
